# CarStore
An academic project that keeps track of a Car Store in C++ and QT for graphic interface.

The aim of this project is focusing on object oriented programming methods and getting a glimpse of fundamental software development patterns.

### Prerequisites
* a C++ IDE (I strongly recommend [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) )
* [QT](https://www.qt.io/download) - a software development framework for designing your project
* [Qt Visual Studio Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TheQtCompany.QtVisualStudioTools-19123) - it's not mandatory
